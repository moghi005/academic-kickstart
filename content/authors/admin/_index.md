I am a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Davis. I am passionate about conducting interdisciplinary research centered at the food-water-energy nexus. My current research focuses on applying innovative technologies (LiDAR and multispectral/hyperspectral imaging), automation (UAVs), and artificial intelligence (machine learning and deep learning algorithms) in agriculture to facilitate the digital revolution in agriculture.
