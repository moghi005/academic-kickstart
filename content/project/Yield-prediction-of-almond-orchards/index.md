# Research Objectives:
Our main goal is to leverage aerial robotics, cutting edge sensing technologies, and advanced analytics
algorithms to:
* Evaluate the canopy size of almond trees in a more affordable, accurate, and
efficient manner. The proposed solution is expected to be an alternative to the [mobile platform lightbar](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11119-015-9387-8) for assessing canopy cover and canopy light interception in almond.
* Estimate yield of almond trees by fusion of UAV-based LiDAR data and hyperspectral images.
