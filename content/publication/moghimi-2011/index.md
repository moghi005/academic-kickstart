abstract: "Viscoelastic behaviour of some commercial sweet cherry cultivars of Iran has been studied in current research. For this purpose, stress relaxation test was conducted on five cultivars of sweet cherry including Siah Mashhad, Abarde, Victoria, Dovom Ras and Tak Dane. Two common models (Generalised Maxwell model and Peleg model) were fitted to the experimental data. Both models could describe stress relaxation behaviour of cherries (R 2 =0.99), but Generalised Maxwell model had lower root mean square error (RMSE) than Peleg model. Based on analysis of stress relaxation data using models constants, Tak Dane exhibited more solid properties, while Victoria showed less elastic behaviour than other cultivars. The results revealed that relaxation ratio (R%) and the area under the stress relaxation curve could be effective alternative to models with easier mathematical procedure. © 2011 The Authors.
