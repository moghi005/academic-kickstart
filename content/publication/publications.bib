abstract = {Visible and near infrared spectroscopic (Vis/NIRS) techniques have shown promise as rapid and non-destructive tools to evaluate the various internal quality attributes of fruits and vegetables. The objective of this study was to develop a calibration model for prediction of soluble solids content and acidity (pH) of kiwifruit by using visible and near infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics. The transmission spectra of kiwifruit were obtained in the wavelength range from 400 to 1000 nm. The effects of different pre-processing methods and spectra treatments, such as standard normal variate transformation (SNV), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and median filter and first derivative (D1) were analysed. The prediction models were developed by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square regression (PLS). The correlation coefficient for soluble solids content and pH were 0.93, 0.943 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.259ÌŠBrix and 0.076, respectively. These results were achieved when SNV was utilised in conjunction with median filter and first derivative. This showed the capability of Vis/NIRS and the important role of chemometrics in developing accurate models for the prediction of kiwifruit internal quality characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2010 IAgrE.},

abstract = {Viscoelastic behaviour of some commercial sweet cherry cultivars of Iran has been studied in current research. For this purpose, stress relaxation test was conducted on five cultivars of sweet cherry including Siah Mashhad, Abarde, Victoria, Dovom Ras and Tak Dane. Two common models (Generalised Maxwell model and Peleg model) were fitted to the experimental data. Both models could describe stress relaxation behaviour of cherries (R 2 =0.99), but Generalised Maxwell model had lower root mean square error (RMSE) than Peleg model. Based on analysis of stress relaxation data using models constants, Tak Dane exhibited more solid properties, while Victoria showed less elastic behaviour than other cultivars. The results revealed that relaxation ratio (R{\%}) and the area under the stress relaxation curve could be effective alternative to models with easier mathematical procedure. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE. Hyperspectral imaging is becoming an increasingly popular tool for high-throughput plant phenotyping, because it provides remarkable insights about the health status of plants. Feature selection is a key component in a hyperspectral image analysis, largely because a significant portion of spectral features are redundant and/or irrelevant, depending on the desired application. This paper presents an ensemble feature selection method to identify the most informative spectral features for practical applications in plant phenotyping. The hyperspectral data set contained the images of four wheat lines, each with a control and a salt (NaCl) treatment. To rank spectral features, six feature selection methods were used as the base for the ensemble: correlation-based feature selection, ReliefF, sequential feature selection, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), LASSO logistic regression, and random forest. The best results were achieved by the ensemble of ReliefF, SVM-RFE, and random forest, which drastically reduced the dimension of the hyperspectral data set from 215 to 15 features, while improving the accuracy in classifying the salt-treated vegetation pixels from the control pixels by 8.5{\%}. To transform the hyperspectral data set into a multispectral data set, six wavelengths as the center of broad multispectral bands around the most prominent features were determined by a clustering algorithm. The result of salt tolerance assessment of the four wheat lines using the derived multispectral data set was similar to that of the hyperspectral data set. This demonstrates that the proposed feature selection pipeline can be utilized for determining the most informative features and can be a valuable tool in the development of tailored multispectral cameras.},

abstract = {Crop production needs to increase in a sustainable manner to meet the growing global demand for food. To identify crop varieties with high yield potential, plant scientists and breeders evaluate the performance of hundreds of lines in multiple locations over several years. To facilitate the process of selecting advanced varieties, an automated framework was developed in this study. A hyperspectral camera was mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle to collect aerial imagery with high spatial and spectral resolution. Aerial images were captured in two consecutive growing seasons from three experimental yield fields composed of hundreds experimental plots (1x2.4 meter), each contained a single wheat line. The grain of more than thousand wheat plots was harvested by a combine, weighed, and recorded as the ground truth data. To leverage the high spatial resolution and investigate the yield variation within the plots, images of plots were divided into sub-plots by integrating image processing techniques and spectral mixture analysis with the expert domain knowledge. Afterwards, the sub-plot dataset was divided into train, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling. Subsequent to extracting features from each sub-plot, deep neural networks were trained for yield estimation. The coefficient of determination for predicting the yield of the test dataset at sub-plot scale was 0.79 with root mean square error of 5.90 grams. In addition to providing insights into yield variation at sub-plot scale, the proposed framework can facilitate the process of high-throughput yield phenotyping as a valuable decision support tool. It offers the possibility of (i) remote visual inspection of the plots, (ii) studying the effect of crop density on yield, and (iii) optimizing plot size to investigate more lines in a dedicated field each year.},
